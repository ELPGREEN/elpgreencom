    "tireRecycling": {
      "q1": "What is the processing capacity of a tire recycling plant?",
      "a1": "Our tire recycling plants have a capacity of 1 to 10 tons per hour, depending on the model chosen. Operating 24/7, an average plant can process up to 30,000 tons of tires per year.",
      "q2": "What are the final products of tire recycling?",
      "a2": "The main products are: granulated rubber (60-65%), high-quality steel (25-30%) and textile fibers (10-15%). The rubber can be sold for flooring, modified asphalt and new rubber products.",
      "q3": "How long does it take to install a complete plant?",
      "a3": "Complete installation takes 3 to 6 months, including site preparation, equipment assembly, testing and team training. We offer technical support throughout the process.",
      "q4": "What is the initial investment required?",
      "a4": "Investment varies from $2 million to $10 million depending on capacity and configuration. We offer different financing models and partnerships to make your project viable.",
      "q5": "What certifications and licenses are required?",
      "a5": "Our equipment has CE and ISO certification. We assist in obtaining local environmental licenses and provide complete documentation for regulatory approval."
    },
    "pyrolysis": {
      "q1": "What is pyrolysis and how does it work?",
      "a1": "Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that decomposes organic materials in the absence of oxygen at temperatures of 400-600°C. It transforms tires into pyrolytic oil, carbon black and recovered steel.",
      "q2": "What is the yield of a pyrolysis plant?",
      "a2": "For every 10 tons of tires, we obtain approximately: 4-4.5 tons of oil, 3-3.5 tons of carbon black, 1.5 tons of steel and 1 ton of gas (used as fuel).",
      "q3": "Is the pyrolysis process safe and environmentally friendly?",
      "a3": "Yes, our plants use advanced emission control systems and operate in a closed loop. The gas produced is reused as fuel, making the process highly efficient and sustainable.",
      "q4": "What is pyrolytic oil used for?",
      "a4": "Pyrolytic oil can be used as industrial fuel, refined to diesel or sold to chemical industries. It has high calorific value and significant market value.",
      "q5": "What is the lifespan of a pyrolysis plant?",
      "a5": "With proper maintenance, our plants have a lifespan of 15-20 years. We offer preventive maintenance contracts and spare parts to ensure continuous operation."
    },
    "otr": {
      "q1": "What are OTR tires and where do they come from?",
      "a1": "OTR means \"Off-The-Road\" – these are giant tires used in mining, ports, agriculture and construction. They can weigh up to 4.5 tons and have a diameter of up to 4.5 meters.",
      "q2": "Why do OTR tires require special equipment?",
      "a2": "Due to their extreme size and weight, OTR tires cannot be processed in conventional shredders. Our OTR line was specifically developed to cut, separate and process these giant tires.",
      "q3": "What is the processing capacity of the OTR line?",
      "a3": "Our complete OTR line processes 10 to 20 tons per hour, equivalent to 3-5 giant mining tires per hour, operating 24/7 with only 2-3 operators per shift.",
      "q4": "What is the value of recycled OTR tire products?",
      "a4": "OTR tires contain high-quality rubber and steel. Rubber blocks are sold at $0.35/kg, steel at $0.55/kg and fibers at $0.20/kg, generating excellent return on investment.",
      "q5": "Do you offer training for OTR line operation?",
      "a5": "Yes, we offer complete 2-4 week training for your team, including operation, preventive maintenance and safety. We also provide 24/7 remote technical support."
    },
    "quotation": {
      "q1": "How do I request a quote?",
      "a1": "You can request a quote through our website by filling out the form on each plant page, or by contacting us directly via email or phone. We will respond within 48 business hours.",
      "q2": "What information is required for a quote?",
      "a2": "We need to know: type of material to process, desired capacity (ton/hour or ton/day), project location, available infrastructure (power, water, space) and implementation timeline.",
      "q3": "How long does it take to receive a commercial proposal?",
      "a3": "After initial analysis, we send a preliminary proposal in 5-7 business days. A detailed technical proposal is provided after a technical visit or in-depth project analysis, within 15 days.",
      "q4": "Do you offer financing or leasing?",
      "a4": "Yes, we work with financial partners to offer financing, leasing and operational partnership options. Each case is analyzed individually to find the best solution.",
      "q5": "What is included in the equipment price?",
      "a5": "Our prices include: complete equipment, technical documentation, initial training, installation supervision and 12-24 month warranty. Freight and installation are quoted separately based on location.",
      "q6": "Do you conduct technical visits before the sale?",
      "a6": "Yes, for large projects, we conduct free technical visits to the installation site. We also invite clients to visit our facilities and see the equipment in operation."
